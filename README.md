### iOS Developer ï£¿

I am currently in a cycle of constant learning and my goal is to gain experience in mobile development for iOS.

My short-term goal is to specialize in frontend as well as mobile development for iOS devices. I am predisposed to improve and add new experiences to improve my skills, both technical and soft.
